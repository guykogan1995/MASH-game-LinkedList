After completing this module I feel like I finally have mastered linked lists. I feel extremely satisfied and previously I always struggled with linked lists. Pointers are extremely useful and in direct modification of a memory address. Building the MASH game was extremely fun. At first my program kept producing the same values once randomized but I quickly learned that was because the time value was at a constant 1. Once I randomized the time value my program got different results every time. I also decided to go with a coin flip on weather female or male names were chosen.

Using unit testing was extremely helpful to building proper methods. I struggled with uknown memory size errors on test 15 that propogated through my program and creating list functions. However I had no memory leaks and was passing all unit tests. I found this program to take me a total time of about 8 hours, which for me is very fast. I can feel myself getting quicker and struggling less even with challenging tasks like building linked lists. I can't wait to learn more and hope to do some extra curricular challenges, learn to create projects without cloning, and learn to build GUI's and executables in C. I can't wait to learn more!
